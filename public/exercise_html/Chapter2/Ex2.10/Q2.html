<p>Question 2.<br/>
Using Euclid’s division lemma, if the cube of any positive integer is divided by 9 then the possible remainders are ………………….<br/>
(1) 0, 1, 8<br/>
(2) 1, 4, 8<br/>
(3) 0, 1, 3<br/>
(4) 1, 3, 5<br/>
Answer:<br/>
(1) 0, 1, 8<br/>
Hint: Let the +ve integer be 1, 2, 3, 4 …………<br/>
1<sup>3</sup> = 1 when it is divided by 9 the remainder is 1.<br/>
2<sup>3</sup> = 8 when it is divided by 9 the remainder is 8.<br/>
3<sup>3</sup> = 27 when it is divided by 9 the remainder is 0.<br/>
4<sup>3</sup> = 64 when it is divided by 9 the remainder is 1.<br/>
5<sup>3</sup> = 125 when it is divided by 9 the remainder is 8.<br/>
The remainder 0, 1, 8 is repeated.</p>
