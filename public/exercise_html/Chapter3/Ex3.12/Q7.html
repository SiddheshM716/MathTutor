<p>Question 7.<br/>
Music is been played in two opposite galleries with certain group of people. In the first gallery a group of 4 singers were singing and in the second gallery 9 singers were singing. The two galleries are separated by the distance of 70 m. Where should a person stand for hearing the same intensity of the singers voice?<br/>
(Hint: The ratio of the sound intensity is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding distances).<br/>
Answer:<br/>
Number of singers in the first group = 4<br/>
Number of singers in the second group = 9<br/>
Distance between the two galleries = 70 m<br/>
Let the distance of the person from the first group be x<br/>
and the distance of the person from the second group be 70 – x<br/>
By the given condition<br/>
4 : 9 = x<sup>2</sup> : (70 – x)<sup>2</sup> (by the given hint)<br/>
\(\frac { 4 }{ 9 } \) = \(\frac{x^{2}}{(70-x)^{2}}\)<br/>
\(\frac { 2 }{ 3 } \) = \(\frac { x }{ 70-x } \) [taking square root on both sides]<br/>
3x = 140 – 2x<br/>
5x = 140<br/>
x = \(\frac { 140 }{ 5 } \) = 28<br/>
The required distance to hear same intensity of the singers voice from the first galleries is 28m<br/>
The required distance to hear same intensity of the singers voice from the second galleries is (70 – 28) = 42 m</p><div class="code-block code-block-8" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
