<p>Question 9.<br/>
Two women together took 100 eggs to a market, one had more than the other. Both sold them for the same sum of money. The first then said to the second: “If I had your eggs, I would have earned ₹ 15”, to which the second replied: “If I had your eggs, I would have earned ₹ 6 \(\frac{2}{3}\) How many eggs did each had in the beginning?<br/>
Solution:<br/>
Let the no. of eggs with woman 1 be x and woman 2 be y.<br/>
∴ x + y = 100<br/>
Let w<sub>1</sub> sell the eggs at ₹ ‘a’ per egg.<br/>
Let w<sub>2</sub> sell the eggs at ₹ ‘b’ per egg.<br/>
Case 1:<br/>
They sold them for same money.<br/>
∴ ax = by<br/>
Case 2:<br/>
ay = 15 and bx = \(\frac{20}{3}\)<br/>
∴ One woman had 40 eggs and the other had 60 eggs.</p><p></p>
