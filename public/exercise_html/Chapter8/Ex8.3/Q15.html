<p>Question 15.<br/>
In a game, the entry fee is â‚¹ 150. The game consists of tossing a coin 3 times. Dhana bought a ticket for entry. If one or two heads show, she gets her entry fee back. If she throws 3 heads, she receives double the entry fees. Otherwise, she will lose. Find the probability that she<br/>
(i) gets double entry fee<br/>
(ii) just gets her entry fee<br/>
(iii) loses the entry fee.<br/>
Answer:<br/>
Sample space (S) = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}<br/>
n(S) = 8<br/>
(i) Let A be the event of getting double entry fee (only getting 3 heads)<br/>
n(A) = 1<br/>
\(P(A)=\frac{n(A)}{n(S)}=\frac{1}{8}\)<br/>
(ii) Let B be the event of getting her entry fee (one or two heads to show)<br/>
n(B) = Probability of one head + Probability of 2 head<br/>
= \(\frac{3}{8}+\frac{3}{8}=\frac{6}{8}=\frac{3}{4}\)<br/>
(iii) To loss the entry means not getting the head (only tail)<br/>
n(C) = 1<br/>
\(P(C)=\frac{n(C)}{n(S)}=\frac{1}{8}\)</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
