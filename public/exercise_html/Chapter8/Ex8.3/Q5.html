<p>Question 5.<br/>
At a fete, cards bearing numbers 1 to 1000, one number on one card are put in a box. Each player selects one card at random and that card is not replaced. If the selected card has a perfect square number greater than 500, the player wins a prize. What is the probability that<br/>
(i) the first player wins a prize<br/>
(ii) the second player wins a prize if the first has won?<br/>
Solution:<br/>
22<sup>2</sup> = 484<br/>
31<sup>2</sup> = 961<br/>
23<sup>2</sup> = 529<br/>
32<sup>2</sup> = 1024<br/>
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 has squares below 500 Ã— 1000.<br/>
(i) P(first player wins a prize) = \(\frac{9}{1000}\)<br/>
(ii) P(second player ins if first has won) = \(\frac{8}{999}\)</p>
