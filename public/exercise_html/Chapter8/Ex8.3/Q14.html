<p>Question 14.<br/>
Two customers Priya and Amuthan are visiting a particular shop in the same week (Monday to Saturday). Each is equally likely to visit the shop on any one day as on another day. What is the probability that both will visit the shop on<br/>
(i) the same day<br/>
(ii) different days<br/>
(iii) consecutive days?<br/>
Answer:<br/>
Sample space (S) = 6 × 6 = 36<br/>
n(S) = 36<br/>
[priya and Amuthan are visiting a particular shop in any one of 6 days is 6 × 6 = 36]<br/>
(i) Let A be the event of getting both are shopping on the same day<br/>
A = {(Mon, Mon) (Tue, Tue) (Wed, Wed) (Thu, Thu) (Fri, Fri) (Sat, Sat)}<br/>
n(A) = 6<br/>
\(P(A)=\frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\)<br/>
\(=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\)<br/>
(ii) Let B be the event of shopping in different days.<br/>
n(B) = 36 – 6 = 30<br/>
\(P(B)=\frac{n(B)}{n(S)}\)<br/>
\(=\frac{30}{36}=\frac{5}{6}\)<br/>
(iii) Let C be the event of shopping consecutive days<br/>
C = {(Mon, Tue) (Tue, Wed) (Wed, Thu) (Thu, Fri) (Fri, Sat)}<br/>
n(C) = 5<br/>
P(C) = \(\frac{n(\mathrm{C})}{n(\mathrm{S})}\) = \(\frac{5}{36}\)</p><p></p>
