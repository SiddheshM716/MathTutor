<p>Question 13.<br/>
Some boys are playing a game, in which the stone thrown by them landing in a circular region given in the figure is considered as win and landing other than the circular region is considered as a loss. What is the probability to win the game?<br/>

Area of a rectangle = l × b sq. feet = 3 × 4 sq. feet = 12 sq. feet<br/>
sample space (S) = 12<br/>
n(S) = 12<br/>
Let A be the event of getting the stone landing in a circular region<br/>
n(A) = Area of a circle<br/>
= πr<sup>2</sup><br/>
= π × 1 × 1 (radius of a circle = 1 feet)<br/>
= π<br/>

Probability to win the game = \(\frac{11}{42}\) (or) \(\frac{157}{600}\)</p>
