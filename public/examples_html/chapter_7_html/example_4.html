<h3>Example 7.4</h3>


<p>If one litre of paint covers 10 m², how many litres of paint is required to paint the internal and external surface areas of a cylindrical tunnel whose thickness is 2 m, internal radius is 6 m and height is 25 m.</p>
<p>Solution: Given that, height h = 25 m; thickness = 2 m</p>
<p>Internal radius r = 6 m</p>
<p>Now, external radius R = 6 + 2 = 8 m</p>
<p>C.S.A. of the cylindrical tunnel = C.S.A. of the hollow cylinder</p>
<p>C.S.A. of the hollow cylinder = 2π(R + r)h sq. units</p>
<p>= 2π(8 + 6) × 25</p>
<p>Hence, C.S.A. of the cylindrical tunnel = 2200 m²</p>
<p>Area covered by one litre of paint = 10 m²</p>
<p>Number of litres required to paint the tunnel = 2200 / 10 = 220</p>
<p>Therefore, 220 litres of paint is needed to paint the tunnel.</p>
