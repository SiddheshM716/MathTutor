<h3>Example 6.25</h3>


<p>As shown in the figure, two trees are standing on flat ground. The angle of elevation of the top of both the trees from a point X on the ground is 40°. If the horizontal distance between X and the smaller tree is 8 m and the distance of the top of the two trees is 20 m, calculate</p>
<p>(i) the distance between the point X and the top of the smaller tree.</p>
<p>(ii) the horizontal distance between the two trees.</p>
<p>(cos 40° = 0.7660)</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Let AB be the height of the bigger tree and CD be the height of the smaller tree and X is the point on the ground.</p>
<p>(i) In the right angled triangle XCD,</p>
<p>cos 40° = XD / CD</p>
<p>XD = CD / cos 40° = 8 / 0.7660 = 10.44 m</p>
<p>Therefore, the distance between X and top of the smaller tree = XD = 10.44 m</p>
<p>(ii) In the right angled triangle XAB,</p>
<p>cos 40° = AX / AB</p>
<p>AX = AB * cos 40° = (20 + 10.44) * 0.7660 = 23.382 m</p>
<p>Therefore, the horizontal distance between two trees = AC = AX - CX = 23.382 - 8 = 15.32 m</p>
