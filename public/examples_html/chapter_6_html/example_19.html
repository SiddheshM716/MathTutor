<h3>Example 6.19</h3>

    <p> A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, which is 48 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 30°. Find the height of the tower.</p>
    <p>Solution: Let PQ be the height of the tower.</p>
    <p>Take PQ = h and QR is the distance between the tower and the point. In the right-angled △PQR, ∠PRQ = 30°.</p>
    <p>tan θ = PQ / QR</p>
    <p>tan 30° = h / 48 ⇒ h = 48 / √3 = 16√3</p>
    <p>Therefore, the height of the tower is 16√3 m.</p>
