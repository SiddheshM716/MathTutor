<h3>Example 6.30</h3>


<p>A man is watching a boat speeding away from the top of a tower. The boat makes an angle of depression of 60° with the man’s eye when at a distance of 200 m from the tower. After 10 seconds, the angle of depression becomes 45°. What is the approximate speed of the boat (in km/hr), assuming that it is sailing in still water? (√3 = 1.732)</p>
<p>Let AB be the tower. Let C and D be the positions of the boat. From the diagram, ∠XAC = 60° = ∠ACB and ∠XAD = 45° = ∠ADB, BC = 200 m.</p>
<p>In the right angled ΔABC, tan 60° = AB / 200, we get AB = 200√3 (1).</p>
<p>In the right angled ΔABD, tan 45° = AB / BD, we get BD = 200√3 [by (1)].</p>
<p>Now, CD = BD - BC, CD = 200√3 - 200 = 200(√3 - 1) = 146.4.</p>
<p>It is given that the distance CD is covered in 10 seconds. That is, the distance of 146.4 m is covered in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Therefore, speed of the boat = distance / time = 146.4 / 10 = 14.64 m/s => 14.64 × 3600 / 1000 km/hr = 52.704 km/hr.</p>
