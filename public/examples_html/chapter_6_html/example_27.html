<h3>Example 6.27</h3>


<p>The horizontal distance between two buildings is 140m. The angle of depression of the top of the first building when seen from the top of the second building is 30°. If the height of the first building is 60m, find the height of the second building. (√3 = 1.732)</p>
<p>Solution: The height of the first building AB = 60m. Now, AB = MD = 60m. Let the height of the second building CD = h. Distance BD = 140m. Now, AM = BD = 140m. From the diagram, ∠XCA = 30° = ∠CAM.</p>
<p>In the right angled △AMC, tan30° = CM/AM</p>
<p>1/√3 = CM/140</p>
<p>CM = 140/√3</p>
<p>CM = 140/1.732</p>
<p>CM = 80.83</p>
<p>Now, h = CD = CM + MD = 80.83 + 60 = 140.83</p>
<p>Therefore, the height of the second building is 140.83 m.</p>
