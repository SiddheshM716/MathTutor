<h3>Example 6.33</h3>


<p>From a window (h metres high above the ground) of a house in a street, the angles of elevation and depression of the top and the foot of another house on the opposite side of the street are θ and φ, respectively. Show that the height of the opposite house is h(1 + cotθ / cotφ).</p>
<p>Solution: Let W be the point on the window where the angles of elevation and depression are measured. Let PQ be the house on the opposite side. Then WA is the width of the street.</p>
<p>Height of the window = h metres = AQ (WR = AQ). Let PA = x metres.</p>
<p>In the right angled ΔPAW, tanθ = AP / AW ⇒ tanθ = x / AW ⇒ AW = x / tanθ ⇒ AW = x cotθ ...(1)</p>
<p>In the right angled ΔQAW, tanφ = AQ / AW ⇒ tanφ = h / AW ⇒ AW = h cotφ ...(2)</p>
<p>From (1) and (2) we get, x cotθ = h cotφ ⇒ x = h cotφ / cotθ.</p>
<p>Therefore, height of the opposite house = PA + AQ = x + h = h cotφ / cotθ + h = h(1 + cotθ / cotφ).</p>
<p>Hence Proved.</p>
