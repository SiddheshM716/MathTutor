<h3>Example 3.36</h3>

  
  <p>The product of Kumaran's age (in years) two years ago and his age four years from now is one more than twice his present age. What is his present age?</p>

  <h3>Solution:</h3>
  <p>Let the present age of Kumaran be \( x \) years.</p>
  
  <p>Two years ago, his age \( = (x - 2) \) years.</p>
  
  <p>Four years from now, his age \( = (x + 4) \) years.</p>
  
  <p>Given:</p>
  <p>\[
    (x - 2)(x + 4) = 1 + 2x
  \]</p>
  
  <p>Expanding and simplifying:</p>
  <p>\[
    x^2 + 2x - 8 = 1 + 2x
  \]</p>
  <p>\[
    x^2 - 9 = 0
  \]</p>
  <p>\[
    (x - 3)(x + 3) = 0
  \]</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, \( x = \pm 3 \) (Rejecting \(-3\) as age cannot be negative)</p>
  
  <p>Kumaran's present age is <strong>3 years</strong>.</p>
