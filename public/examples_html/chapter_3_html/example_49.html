<h3>Example 3.49</h3>

<p> A company initially started with 40 workers to complete the work by 150 days. Later, it decided to fasten up the work increasing the number of workers as shown below.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Number of workers (x)</th>
    <td>40</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>60</td>
    <td>75</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Number of days (y)</th>
    <td>150</td>
    <td>120</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>80</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>(i) Graph the above data and identify the type of variation.</p>
<p>(ii) From the graph, find the number of days required to complete the work if the company decides to opt for 120 workers?</p>
<p>(iii) If the work has to be completed by 200 days, how many workers are required?</p>
<p>From the given table, we observe that as x increases, y decreases. Thus, the variation is an inverse variation.</p>
<p>Let \( y = \frac{k}{x} \)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow xy = k \), \( k > 0 \) is called the constant of variation.</p>
<p>From the table, \( k = 40 \times 150 = 50 \times 120 = \ldots = 75 \times 80 = 6000 \)</p>
<p>Therefore, \( xy = 6000 \)</p>
<p>Plot the points (40,150), (50,120), (60,100), (75,80) and join to get a free hand smooth curve (Rectangular Hyperbola).</p>
<p>(ii) From the graph, the required number of days to complete the work when the company decides to work with 120 workers is 50 days.</p>
<p>Also, from \( xy = 6000 \) if \( x = 120 \), then \( y = \frac{6000}{120} = 50 \)</p>
<p>(iii) From the graph, if the work has to be completed by 200 days, the number of workers required is 30.</p>
<p>Also, from \( xy = 6000 \) if \( y = 200 \), then \( x = \frac{6000}{200} = 30 \)</p>
