<h3>Example 3.39</h3>

<p> A passenger train takes 1 hr more than an express train to travel a distance of 240 km from Chennai to Virudhachalam. The speed of the express train is more than that of the passenger train by 20 km per hour. Find the average speed of both the trains.</p>
<p>Solution Let the average speed of passenger train be x km/hr.</p>
<p>Then the average speed of express train will be (x + 20) km/hr</p>
<p>Time taken by the passenger train to cover distance of 240 km = 240/x hr</p>
<p>Time taken by express train to cover distance of 240 km = 240/(x + 20) hr</p>
<p>Given, 240/x - 240/(x + 20) = 1</p>
<p>240(x + 20) - 240x = x(x + 20)</p>
<p>4800 = x² + 20x</p>
<p>x² + 20x - 4800 = 0</p>
<p>(x + 80)(x - 60) = 0</p>
<p>we get, x = -80 or 60.</p>
<p>Therefore x = 60 (Rejecting -80 as speed cannot be negative)</p>
<p>Average speed of the passenger train is 60 km/hr</p>
<p>Average speed of the express train is 80 km/hr.</p>
