<h3>Example 3.38</h3>

<p> A flock of swans contained x<sup>2</sup> members. As the clouds gathered, 10x went to a lake and one-eighth of the members flew away to a garden. The remaining three pairs played about in the water. How many swans were there in total?</p>

<p>Solution As given there are x<sup>2</sup> swans.</p>

<p>As per the given data x<sup>2</sup> - 10x - (1/8)x<sup>2</sup> = 6 we get, 7x<sup>2</sup> - 80x - 48 = 0</p>

<p>x = [-b ± √(b<sup>2</sup>-4ac)] / 2a = [80 ± √(6400 - 4(7)(-48))] / 14 = [80 ± 88] / 14</p>

<p>Therefore, x = 12, -4/7.</p>

<p>Here x = -4/7 is not possible as the number of swans cannot be negative.</p>

<p>Hence, x = 12. Therefore total number of swans is x<sup>2</sup> = 144.</p>
