<h3>Example 3.50</h3>


<p>Nishanth is the winner in a Marathon race of 12 km distance. He ran at the uniform speed of 12 km/hr and reached the destination in 1 hour. He was followed by Aradhana, Jeyanth, Sathya and Swetha with their respective speed of 6 km/hr, 4 km/hr, 3 km/hr and 2 km/hr. And, they covered the distance in 2 hrs, 3 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hours respectively.</p>
<p>Draw the speed-time graph and use it to find the time taken to Kaushik with his speed of 2.4 km/hr.</p>
<p>Solution: Let us form the table with the given details.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Speed (km/hr)</th>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Time (hours)</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>From the table, we observe that as speed decreases, time increases. Hence, the type is inverse variation.</p>
<p>Let \( y = \frac{k}{x} \), where \( k > 0 \) is called the constant of variation.</p>
<p>From the table, \( k = 12 \times 1 = 6 \times 2 = 4 \times 3 = 3 \times 4 = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).</p>
<p>Therefore, \( xy = 12 \).</p>
<p>Plot the points (12,1), (6,2), (4,3), (3,4), (2,6) and join these points by a smooth curve (Rectangular Hyperbola).</p>
<p>From the graph, we observe that Kaushik takes 5 hrs with a speed of 2.4 km/hr.</p>
