<h3>Example 3.47</h3>


<p>Varshika drew 6 circles with different sizes. Draw a graph for the relationship between the diameter and circumference (approximately related) of each circle as shown in the table and use it to find the circumference of a circle when its diameter is 6 cm.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Diameter (x) cm</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Circumference (y) cm</th>
    <td>3.1</td>
    <td>6.2</td>
    <td>9.3</td>
    <td>12.4</td>
    <td>15.5</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>From the table, we found that as x increases, y also increases. Thus, the variation is a direct variation.</p>
<p>Let \( y = kx \), where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.</p>
<p>From the given values, we have,</p>
<p>\( k = \frac{3.1}{1} = 3.1 \)</p>
<p>When you plot the points (1, 3.1), (2, 6.2), (3, 9.3), (4, 12.4), (5, 15.5), you find the relation \( y = 3.1x \) forms a straight-line graph.</p>
<p>Clearly, from the graph, when diameter is 6 cm, its circumference is 18.6 cm.</p>
