<h3>Example 3.4</h3>


<p>In an interschool athletic meet, with a total of 24 individual prizes, securing a total of 56 points, a first place secures 5 points, a second place secures 3 points, and a third place secures 1 point. Having as many third place finishers as first and second place finishers, find how many athletes finished in each place.</p>
<p>Solution: Let the number of I, II and III place finishers be x, y and z respectively.</p>
<p>Total number of prizes = 24; Total number of points = 56.</p>
<p>Hence, the linear equations in three variables are:</p>
<p>x + y + z = 24 ...(1)</p>
<p>5x + 3y + z = 56 ...(2)</p>
<p>x + y = z ...(3)</p>
<p>Substituting (3) in (1) we get, z + z = 24 ⇒ z = 12</p>
<p>∴ (3) will be, x + y = 12</p>
<p>(2) ⇒ 5x + 3y + 12 = 56 ⇒ 5x + 3y = 44</p>
<p>3 × (3) ⇒ 3x + 3y = 36</p>
<p>Subtracting, 2x = 8 ⇒ x = 4</p>
<p>Substituting x = 4, z = 12 in (3) we get, y = 12 - 4 = 8</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>Number of first place finishers is 4</p>
<p>Number of second place finishers is 8</p>
<p>Number of third place finishers is 12.</p>
