<h3>Example 5.27</h3>

<p> A mobile phone is put to use when the battery power is 100%. The percent of battery power "y" (in decimal) remaining after using the mobile phone for "x" hours is assumed as y = -0.25x + 1</p>
<p>(i) Find the number of hours elapsed if the battery power is 40%.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>(i) To find the time when the battery power is 40%, we have to take y = 0.40</p>
<p>0.40 = -0.25x + 1 â‡’ 0.25x = 0.60</p>
<p>We get, x = 0.60 / 0.25 = 2.4 hours.</p>
<p>(ii) If the battery power is 0 then y = 0</p>
<p>Therefore, 0 = -0.25x + 1 gives 0.25x = 1 hence x = 4 hours.</p>
<p>Thus, after 4 hours, the battery of the mobile phone will have no power.</p>
