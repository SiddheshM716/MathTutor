<h3>Example 5.17</h3>


<p>Find the equation of a straight line passing through (5,7) and is (i) parallel to X axis (ii) parallel to Y axis.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>(i) The equation of any straight line parallel to X axis is y=b. Since it passes through (5,7), b= 7. Therefore, the required equation of the line is y=7.</p>
<p>(ii) The equation of any straight line parallel to Y axis is x=c. Since it passes through (5,7), c =5. Therefore, the required equation of the line is x=5.</p>
