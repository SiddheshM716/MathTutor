<h3>Example 5.29</h3>


<p>(a) (i) East Avenue is the straight line joining C(0,2) and B(7,2). Thus the equation of East Avenue is obtained by using two-point form which is</p>
<p>\(\frac{y-2}{2-2} = \frac{x-0}{7-0}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{y-2}{0} = \frac{x}{7}\)</p>
<p>\(y = 2\)</p>
<p>(ii) Since the point D lies vertically above C(0,2). The x-coordinate of D is 0. Since any point on North Street has x-coordinate value 0, the equation of North Street is \(x = 0\).</p>
<p>(iii) To find the equation of Cross Road. Center of circular garden M is at (7,7), A is (3,10). We first find the slope of MA, which we call \(m_1\). Thus \(m_1 = \frac{10-7}{3-7} = -\frac{3}{4}\). Since the Cross Road is perpendicular to MA, if \(m_2\) is the slope of the Cross Road then, \(m_1m_2 = -1\) gives \(-\frac{3}{4}m_2 = -1\) so \(m_2 = \frac{4}{3}\). Now, the Cross Road has slope \(\frac{4}{3}\) and it passes through the point A(3,10). The equation of the Cross Road is \(y - 10 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 3)\).</p>
<p>\(3y - 30 = 4x - 12\)</p>
<p>Hence, \(4x - 3y + 18 = 0\)</p>
<p>(b) (i) If D is (0,k) then D is a point on the Cross Road. Therefore, substituting \(x=0\), \(y=k\) in the equation of Cross Road, we get, \(0 - 3k + 18 = 0\). Value of \(k=6\). Therefore, D is (0,6).</p>
<p>(ii) To find E, let E be (q,2). Put \(y = 2\) in the equation of the Cross Road, we get, \(4q - 6 + 18 = 0\). \(4q = -12\) gives \(q = -3\). Therefore, the point E is (-3,2).</p>
<p>Thus the Cross Road meets the North Street at D(0,6) and East Avenue at E(-3,2).</p>
