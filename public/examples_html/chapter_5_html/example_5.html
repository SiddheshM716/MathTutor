<h3>Example 5.5</h3>


<p>The floor of a hall is covered with identical tiles which are in the shapes of triangles. One such triangle has the vertices at (−3,2), (−1,−1) and (1,2). If the floor of the hall is completely covered by 110 tiles, find the area of the floor.</p>
<p>Vertices of one triangular tile are at (−3,2), (−1,−1) and (1,2).</p>
<p>Area of this tile = \(\frac{1}{2} \left| (−3)(−1 − 2) + (−1)(2 − 2) + 1(2 − (−1)) \right|\) sq.units</p>
<p>\(= \frac{1}{2} \left| 9 + 0 + 3 \right| = 6\) sq.units</p>
<p>Since the floor is covered by 110 triangle shaped identical tiles,</p>
<p>Area of floor = \(110 \times 6 = 660\) sq.units</p>
