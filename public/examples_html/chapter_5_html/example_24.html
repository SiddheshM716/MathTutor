<h3>Example 5.24</h3>


    <p>Two buildings of different heights are located at opposite sides of each other. If a heavy rod is attached joining the terrace of the buildings from (6,10) to (14,12), find the equation of the rod joining the buildings?</p>
    <p>Let A(6,10), B(14,12) be the points denoting the terrace of the buildings.</p>
    <p>The equation of the rod is the equation of the straight line passing through A(6,10) and B(14,12).</p>
    <p>\[
      \frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y_1} = \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\
      \frac{y - 10}{12 - 10} = \frac{x - 6}{14 - 6} \\
      \frac{y - 10}{2} = \frac{x - 6}{8} \\
      x - 4y + 34 = 0
    \]</p>
    <p>Hence, equation of the rod is \(x - 4y + 34 = 0\).</p>
