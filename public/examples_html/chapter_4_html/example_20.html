<h3>Example 4.20</h3>


<p>An insect 8 m away initially from the foot of a lamp post which is 6 m tall, crawls towards it moving through a distance. If its distance from the top of the lamp post is equal to the distance it has moved, how far is the insect away from the foot of the lamp post?</p>
<p>Solution: Distance between the insect and the foot of the lamp post BD = 8m</p>
<p>The height of the lamp post, AB = 6m</p>
<p>After moving a distance of x m, let the insect be at C</p>
<p>Let, AC = CD = z. Then BC = BD - CD = 8 - z</p>
<p>In △ABC, ∠B = 90°</p>
<p>AC² = AB² + BC² gives z² = 6² + (8 - z)²</p>
<p>z² = 36 + 64 - 16z + z²</p>
<p>16z = 100 then z = 6.25</p>
<p>Then, BC = 8 - z = 8 - 6.25 = 1.75m</p>
<p>Therefore the insect is 1.75 m away from the foot of the lamp post.</p>
