<h3>Example 4.9</h3>


<p>Two poles of height ‘a’ metres and ‘b’ metres are ‘p’ metres apart. Prove that the height of the point of intersection of the lines joining the top of each pole to the foot of the opposite pole is given by \(\frac{ab}{a+b}\) metres.</p>
<p>Let AB and CD be two poles of height ‘a’ metres and ‘b’ metres respectively such that the poles are ‘p’ metres apart. That is AC = p metres. Suppose the lines AD and BC meet at O, such that OL = h metres.</p>
<p>Let CL = x and LA = y. Then, \(x + y = p\).</p>
<p>In \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle LOC\), we have \(\angle CAB = \angle CLO\) [each equal to 90°].</p>
<p>\(\triangle CAB \sim \triangle CLO\) [By AA similarity].</p>
<p>\(\frac{CA}{CL} = \frac{AB}{LO} \Rightarrow \frac{p}{x} = \frac{a}{h}\)</p>
<p>So, \(x = \frac{ph}{a}\) ...(1)</p>
<p>In \(\triangle ALO\) and \(\triangle ACD\), we have \(\angle ALO = \angle ACD\) [each equal to 90°].</p>
<p>\(\angle A = \angle A\) [A is common].</p>
<p>\(\triangle ALO \sim \triangle ACD\) [by AA similarity].</p>
<p>\(\frac{AL}{AC} = \frac{OL}{DC} \Rightarrow \frac{y}{p} = \frac{h}{b}\)</p>
<p>We get, \(y = \frac{ph}{b}\) ...(2)</p>
<p>(1) + (2) \(\Rightarrow x + y = \frac{ph}{a} + \frac{ph}{b}\)</p>
<p>\(p = ph \left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\right)\) (Since \(x + y = p\))</p>
<p>\(\frac{1}{h} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\)</p>
<p>Therefore, \(h = \frac{ab}{a + b}\)</p>
<p>Hence, the height of the intersection of the lines joining the top of each pole to the foot of the opposite pole is \(\frac{ab}{a + b}\) metres.</p>
