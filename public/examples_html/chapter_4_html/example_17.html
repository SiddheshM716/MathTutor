<h3>Example 4.17</h3>


<p>Construct a ΔPQR in which PQ = 8 cm, ∠R = 60° and the median RG from R to PQ is 5.8 cm. Find the length of the altitude from R to PQ.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>Construction:</p>

<p>Step 1: Draw a line segment PQ = 8 cm.</p>

<p>Step 2: At P, draw PE such that ∠QPE = 60°.</p>

<p>Step 3: At P, draw PF such that ∠EPF = 90°.</p>

<p>Step 4: Draw the perpendicular bisector to PQ, which intersects PF at O and PQ at G.</p>

<p>Step 5: With O as centre and OP as radius, draw a circle.</p>

<p>Step 6: From G, mark arcs of radius 5.8 cm on the circle. Mark them as R and S.</p>

<p>Step 7: Join PR and RQ. Then ΔPQR is the required triangle.</p>

<p>Step 8: From R, draw a line RN perpendicular to PQ. PQ meets RN at M.</p>

<p>Step 9: The length of the altitude is RM = 3.8 cm.</p>
