<h3>Example 4.10</h3>

<Example 4.10> Construct a triangle similar to a given triangle PQR with its sides equal to 3/5 of the corresponding sides of the triangle PQR (scale factor = 3/5 < 1).</Example>
<p>Solution: Given a triangle PQR, we are required to construct another triangle whose sides are 3/5 of the corresponding sides of the triangle PQR.</p>
<p>Steps of construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Construct a △PQR with any measurement.</li>
  <li>Draw a ray QX making an acute angle with QR on the side opposite to vertex P.</li>
  <li>Locate 5 (the greater of 3 and 5 in 3/5) points Q₁, Q₂, Q₃, Q₄, and Q₅ on QX so that QQ₁ = Q₁Q₂ = Q₂Q₃ = Q₃Q₄ = Q₄Q₅.</li>
  <li>Join Q₅R and draw a line through Q₃ (the third point, 3 being smaller of 3 and 5 in 3/5) parallel to Q₅R to intersect QR at R′.</li>
  <li>Draw line through R′ parallel to the line RP to intersect QP at P′.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, △P′QR′ is the required triangle each of whose sides is three-fifths of the corresponding sides of △PQR.</p>
