<h3>Example 4.23</h3>


<p>An aeroplane after take off from an airport and flies due north at a speed of 1000 km/hr. At the same time, another aeroplane takes off from the same airport and flies due west at a speed of 1200 km/hr. How far apart will be the two planes after 1.5 hours?</p>
<p>Solution: Let the first aeroplane starts from O and goes up to A towards north, where OA = 1000 × 1.5 km = 1500 km.</p>
<p>Let the second aeroplane starts from O at the same time and goes up to B towards west, where OB = 1200 × 1.5 = 1800 km.</p>
<p>The required distance to be found is BA. In right angled triangle AOB, AB² = OA² + OB².</p>
<p>AB² = (1500)² + (1800)² = 100² (15² + 18²) = 100² × 549 = 100² × 9 × 61.</p>
<p>AB = 100 × 3 × √61 = 300√61 km.</p>
