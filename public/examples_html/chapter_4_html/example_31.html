<h3>Example 4.31</h3>


<p>Draw a circle of diameter 6 cm from a point P, which is 8 cm away from its centre. Draw the two tangents PA and PB to the circle and measure their lengths.</p>
<p>Solution: Given, diameter (d) = 6 cm, we find radius (r) = 3 cm</p>
<p>Construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With centre at O, draw a circle of radius 3 cm.</li>
  <li>Draw a line OP of length 8 cm.</li>
  <li>Draw a perpendicular bisector of OP, which cuts OP at M.</li>
  <li>With M as centre and MO as radius, draw a circle which cuts the previous circle at A and B.</li>
  <li>Join AP and BP. AP and BP are the required tangents. Thus, the length of the tangents are PA = PB = 7.4 cm.</li>
</ol>
<p>Verification: In the right angle triangle OAP, PA² = OP² - OA² = 8² - 3² = 64 - 9 = 55. Therefore, PA = √55 ≈ 7.4 cm (approximately).</p>
