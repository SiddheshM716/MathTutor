<h3>Example 8.24</h3>

<p> A game of chance consists of spinning an arrow which is equally likely to come to rest pointing to one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ...12. What is the probability that it will point to (i) 7 (ii) a prime number (iii) a composite number?</p>
<p>Solution: Sample space S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}; n(S) = 12</p>
<p>(i) Let A be the event of resting in 7. n(A)=1</p>
<p>P(A) = n(A)/n(S) = 1/12</p>
<p>(ii) Let B be the event that the arrow will come to rest in a prime number. B = {2,3,5,7,11}; n(B) =5</p>
<p>P(B) = n(B)/n(S) = 5/12</p>
<p>(iii) Let C be the event that arrow will come to rest in a composite number. C = {4,6,8,9,10,12}; n(C) =6</p>
<p>P(C) = n(C)/n(S) = 6/12 = 1/2</p>
