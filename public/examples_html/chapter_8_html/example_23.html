<h3>Example 8.23</h3>

    <p> A bag contains 6 green balls, some black and red balls. Number of black balls is as twice as the number of red balls. Probability of getting a green ball is thrice the probability of getting a red ball. Find (i) number of black balls (ii) total number of balls.</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <p>Number of green balls is n(G) = 6</p>
    <p>Let number of red balls is n(R) = x</p>
    <p>Therefore, number of black balls is n(B) = 2x</p>
    <p>Total number of balls n(S) = 6 + x + 2x = 6 + 3x</p>
    <p>It is given that, P(G) = 3 × P(R)</p>
    <p>\(\frac{6}{6 + 3x} = 3 \times \frac{x}{6 + 3x}\)</p>
    <p>3x = 6 gives, x = 2</p>
    <p>(i) Number of black balls = 2 × 2 = 4</p>
    <p>(ii) Total number of balls = 6 + (3 × 2) = 12</p>
