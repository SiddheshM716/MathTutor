<h3>Example 8.18</h3>


<p>A bag contains 5 blue balls and 4 green balls. A ball is drawn at random from the bag. Find the probability that the ball drawn is (i) blue (ii) not blue.</p>
<p>Solution: Total number of possible outcomes n(S) = 5 + 4 = 9</p>
<p>(i) Let A be the event of getting a blue ball. Number of favourable outcomes for the event A. Therefore, n(A) = 5. Probability that the ball drawn is blue. Therefore, P(A) = 5/9.</p>
<p>(ii) A will be the event of not getting a blue ball. So P(A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9.</p>
