<h3>Example 8.21</h3>

<p> What is the probability that a leap year selected at random will contain 53 Saturdays?</p>
<p>Solution: A leap year has 366 days. So it has 52 full weeks and 2 days. 52 Saturdays must be in 52 full weeks.</p>
<p>The possible chances for the remaining two days will be the sample space.</p>
<p>S = {Sun-Mon, Mon-Tue, Tue-Wed, Wed-Thu, Thu-Fri, Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun}</p>
<p>n(S) = 7</p>
<p>Let A be the event of getting 53rd Saturday. Then A = {Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun}; n(A) = 2</p>
<p>Probability of getting 53 Saturdays in a leap year is P(A) = n(A)/n(S) = 2/7</p>
