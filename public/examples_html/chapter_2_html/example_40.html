<h3>Example 2.40</h3>


<p>Which of the following sequences form a Geometric Progression?</p>
<p>(i) 7, 14, 21, 28, ...</p>
<p>Since the ratios between successive terms are not equal, the sequence 7, 14, 21, 28, ... is not a Geometric Progression.</p>
<p>(ii) 1/2, 1, 2, 4, ...</p>
<p>Here the ratios between successive terms are equal. Therefore the sequence 1/2, 1, 2, 4, ... is a Geometric Progression with common ratio r = 2.</p>
<p>(iii) 5, 25, 50, 75, ...</p>
<p>Since the ratios between successive terms are not equal, the sequence 5, 25, 50, 75, ... is not a Geometric Progression.</p>
