<h3>Example 2.37</h3>

<p> A mosaic is designed in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 12 ft on each side. Each tile in the mosaic is in the shape of an equilateral triangle of 12 inch side. The tiles are alternate in colour as shown in the figure. Find the number of tiles of each colour and total number of tiles in the mosaic.</p>
<p>Solution Since the mosaic is in the shape of an equilateral triangle of 12 feet, and the tile is in the shape of an equilateral triangle of 12 inch (1 feet), there will be 12 rows in the mosaic.</p>
<p>From the figure, it is clear that number of white tiles in each row are 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 12 which clearly forms an Arithmetic Progression.</p>
<p>Similarly the number of blue tiles in each row are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 11 which is also an Arithmetic Progression.</p>
<p>Number of white tiles = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = 78</p>
<p>Number of blue tiles = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 11 = 66</p>
<p>The total number of tiles in the mosaic = 78 + 66 = 144</p>
