<h3>Example 2.30</h3>

<p> A mother divides ₹207 into three parts such that the amounts are in A.P. and gives it to her three children. The product of the two least amounts that the children had is 4623. Find the amount received by each child.</p>
<p>Solution: Let the amount received by the three children be in the form of A.P. is given by \(a - d\), \(a\), \(a + d\). Since, the sum of the amount is ₹207, we have</p>
<p>\[
(a - d) + a + (a + d) = 207
\]</p>
<p>\[
3a = 207 \Rightarrow a = 69
\]</p>
<p>It is given that the product of the two least amounts is 4623.</p>
<p>\[
(a - d)a = 4623
\]</p>
<p>\[
(69 - d) \times 69 = 4623
\]</p>
<p>\[
d = 2
\]</p>
<p>Therefore, the amount given by the mother to her three children are</p>
<p>₹(69 - 2), ₹69, and ₹(69 + 2). That is, ₹67, ₹69, and ₹71.</p>
