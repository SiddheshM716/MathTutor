<h3>Example 1.8</h3>


<p>If X = {-5,1,3,4} and Y = {a,0,c}, then which of the following relations are functions from X to Y?</p>
<p>(i) R = {(-5,a), (1,0), (3,c)}</p>
<p>R is not a function as 4 ∈ X does not have an image in Y.</p>
<p>(ii) R = {(-5,a), (1,a), (3,c), (4,c)}</p>
<p>R is a function as each element of X has a unique image in Y.</p>
<p>(iii) R = {(-5,a), (1,a), (3,0), (4,c), (1,5)}</p>
<p>R is not a function as 1 ∈ X has two images a ∈ Y and 5 ∈ Y.</p>
