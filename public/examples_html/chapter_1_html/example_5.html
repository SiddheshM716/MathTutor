<h3>Example 1.5</h3>

<p> The arrow diagram shows a relationship between the sets P and Q. Write the relation in (i) Set builder form (ii) Roster form (iii) What is the domain and range of R.</p>

<p>Solution</p>

<p>(i) Set builder form of R = {(x,y)|y = x-2, x ∈ P, y ∈ Q}</p>

<p>(ii) Roster form R = {(5,3),(6,4),(7,5)}</p>

<p>(iii) Domain of R = {5,6,7} and range of R = {3,4,5}</p>

<p>Let us consider the following example. Suppose A = {-3,-2,-1} and B = {1,2,3,4}. A relation from A to B is defined as a-b = 8 i.e., there is no pair(a,b) such that a-b=8. Thus R contain no element and so R=∅.</p>

<p>A relation which contains no element is called a "Null relation".</p>

<p>1. Let A = {1,2,3,7} and B = {3,0,-1,7}, which of the following are relation from A to B?</p>
<p>(i) R<sub>1</sub> = {(2,1), (7,1)}</p>
<p>(ii) R<sub>2</sub> = {(-1,1)}</p>
<p>(iii) R<sub>3</sub> = {(2,-1), (7,7), (1,3)}</p>
<p>(iv) R<sub>4</sub> = {(7,-1), (0,3), (3,3), (0,7)}</p>

<p>2. Let A = {1,2,3,4,...,45} and R be the relation defined as "square is of a number" on A. Write R as a subset of A×A. Also, find the domain and range of R.</p>

<p>3. A Relation R is given by the set {(x, y) | y = x+3, x ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5}}. Determine its domain and range.</p>

<p>4. Represent each of the given relations by (a) an arrow diagram, (b) a graph and (c) a set in roster form, wherever possible.</p>
<p>(i) {(x,y)|x = 2y, x ∈ {2,3,4,5}, y ∈ {1,2,3,4}}</p>
<p>(ii) {(x,y)|y = x+3, x, y are natural numbers < 10}</p>

<p>5. A company has four categories of employees given by Assistants (A), Clerks (C), Managers (M) and an Executive Officer (E). The company provide ₹10,000, ₹25,000, ₹50,000 and ₹1,00,000 as salaries to the people who work in the categories A, C, M and E respectively. If A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub> and A<sub>5</sub> were Assistants; C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> were Clerks; M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub> were managers and E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub> were Executive officers and if the relation R is defined by xRy, where x is the salary given to person y, express the relation R through an ordered pair and an arrow diagram.</p>
