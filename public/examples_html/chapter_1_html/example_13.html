<h3>Example 1.13</h3>


<p>Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\} \) and \( f = \{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)\} \) be a function from \( A \) to \( B \). Show that \( f \) is one-one but not onto function.</p>
<p>Solution: \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\} \); \( f = \{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)\} \).</p>
<p>Then \( f \) is a function from \( A \) to \( B \) and for different elements in \( A \), there are different images in \( B \). Hence \( f \) is one-one function. Note that the element 7 in the co-domain does not have any pre-image in the domain. Hence \( f \) is not onto.</p>
<p>Therefore, \( f \) is one-one but not an onto function.</p>
